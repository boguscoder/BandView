# BandView
Test app for Android written in C#/Xamarin that shows all MS Band's sensor information live

While work is in early stages this project is a sandbox for different Xamarin-compatible nuget packages and Xamarin components 

POIs:
* RecyclerView
* MS Band SDK (Note: this is not native but java-wrapped Xamarin version, kinda lame =\ )
* Cheeseknife 
* OxyPlot
* OpenTK
